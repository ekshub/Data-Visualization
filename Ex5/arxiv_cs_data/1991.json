        "summary": "This article is a sketch of ideas that were once intended to appear in the author's famous series, \"The Art of Computer Programming\". He generalizes the notion of a context-free language from a set to a multiset of words over an alphabet. The idea is to keep track of the number of ways to parse a string. For example, \"fruit flies like a banana\" can famously be parsed in two ways; analogous examples in the setting of programming languages may yet be important in the future.   The treatment is informal but essentially rigorous.",
